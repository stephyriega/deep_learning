# Deep Learning methods
Here you can find a series of Jupyter Notebooks, I worked on for a class of Deep Learning in QLAB-PUCP. Here we show our skills in the following Advance Machine Learning Methods and Models:
Methods: Data augmentation using ImageDataGenerator
Models: Convolutional Neural Networks with batch normalization, dropout, Max pooling, flatten, dense and convolutional layers.
